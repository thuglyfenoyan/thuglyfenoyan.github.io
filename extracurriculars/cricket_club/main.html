                Being passionate about the sport, I searched for a community of Cricket-loving students at my school. To my 
                surprise, there were no extracurricular activities available to satisfy my desires. Me and my close friend felt this as an 
                opportunity to obtain supervision and start our very own Cricket Club, where students can relax and enjoy the sport 
                after a long day of work. <br><br>

                Within our first week, we had gathered a group of passionate cricket fans who were willing to play every week 
                after school for a few hours. Inside our school's gymnasium, we organized matches till the end of the school year.
                Most of our matches were quite remarkable since they involved dramatic collapses, unbelievable fightbacks, 
                spectacular innnigs and gracious spells. It was always a thrilling end to a hectic day at school, which is why 
                people played in the Cricket club regularly.
