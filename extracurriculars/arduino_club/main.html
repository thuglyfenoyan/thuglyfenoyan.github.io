                After sensing a lack of STEM clubs, I took it upon myself to found my school's first ever Arduino Club. 
                In simple language, Arduino is a device through which you can connect and control motors, sensors etc. The purpose of 
                the club was simple; to teach beginners in my school the foundations of robotics through project-based learning 
                strategies.

                We completed many projects and prototypes in the club, such as an RFID Door Lock, a membrane keypad door lock, 
                a smart dustbin, a line following robot etc. Some of these projects can be found in the <a href="../../personal_projects/index.html">projects section</a> of the 
                website. <br><br>
                After seeing the progress of this club, my robotics teacher decided to merge Arduino club with the robotics team in Grade 12
                with the ultimate goal of teaching junior students the foundations and principles of mechatronics and computer 
                engineering.
