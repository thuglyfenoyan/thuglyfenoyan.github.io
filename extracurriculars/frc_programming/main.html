                Following a succession of programming course completions and certificates in Grade 10, I joined my school's robotics team, FRC 4015. 
                The team consisted of 4 subteams, namely mechanical, electrical, design and programming. In grade 11, 
                I was promoted to sub-lead for the programming department. My job was to program the main subsystems of the robot and 
                to nurture junior students in the world of programming.

            Our team was never a formidable force; we only participated in district events with no success. However, that changed in 
            2022 when we won the <a href="../../achievements/robotics/main.html">Humber College District Event.</a> For the first time in school history, our team had won a gold medal, 
            ultimately securing us a spot in the 2022 FRC Ontario Provincial Championships (also the first time in school history).
