                During Grade 11 and Grade 12, I was part of my school's Varsity Table-Tennis team. Starting off as an unexperienced 
                singles, I slowly improved various aspects of my game and transformed into a doubles player. I was part of 2 main 
                competitions during both seasons; the regular season and ROPSSAA championships. The regular season was a round-robin style 
                tournament where schools competed against each other in a best-of-7 match. The ROPSSAA championships was a knockout 
                tournament designed to crown the best players in each category.

                In Grade 11, the regular season was quite disappointing according to my standards. Our school was only successful in getting 
                2 victories throughout the season. However, the ROPSSAA champtionships was a different story. I placed 6th with my 
                friend for Senior Boys' Doubles in my division. It was a great finish to my debut season and a wonderful start to my 
                final year.
