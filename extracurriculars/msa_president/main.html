                As a Muslim, it is an obligation upon me to pray 5 times a day within the confined time limits. Sometimes, it is 
                difficult for me and other fellow Muslims to follow these commandments, either due to short timings because of school hours 
                or due to the fact that there was no space for us to pray. The purpose of the Muslim Student Association was to firstly 
                provide the Muslim population at St Joseph Secondary School with an easily accessible prayer room.

                In Grade 12, I was appointed as the President of the MSA. My first act was to construct a team of competent and 
                dedicated students who strived to lead through example within their respective communities. We sought to unite the 
                Muslim population in our school through organizing events and hosting congregational prayers. Sometimes, I used to 
                take on the responsibility of leading such prayers, due to my experience. <br>Further media can be found at @sjss_msa on
