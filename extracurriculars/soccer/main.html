                The beautiful game has a special place in my heart. For the past 5 years, my favourite hobby has been playing soccer 
                with my friends at the park. This was the only time in which I could improve on the technical aspects of my game, since 
                I never trained in an academy. However, this changed when I made it into my 
                school's Varsity Soccer team.

            The season was majestic. After an embarassing loss in the first game and a heartbreak against our local rivals, our team 
            bounced back and qualified for the playoffs through the finest of margins (winning our last game 4-3 against the other 
            team that could have qualified). We were Seed 8 and had to play Seed 1, who happened to be the same rivals and were 
            undefeated throughout the group stages. They were strong contenders for the championship and nobody expected us to beat them. 
            But we did. And we did so in dramatic fashion. Through an 89th minute free kick, winning us the game 1-0 and qualifying us 
            for the semifinals while also knocking out the favourites. Unfortunately, our miraculous journey ended after our loss in 
            the semifinals. But it was great while it lasted.
