                During Grade 10, I stumbled upon a club at our school that was run by one of the most brilliant individuals 
                I've met in my life. He was the same person who introduced me to the world of programming in robotics. He used 
                the Problem Solving Club as a platform to introduce new mathematical concepts, and more importantly, taught us to 
                combine these concepts in a creative and systematic manner to tackle problems.

            <h2>Chess Club</h2>
            <p id="paragraph">
                During lockdown in Grade 9, I was informed about our school's online chess club by my friends. What began as a 
                wholesome hobby quickly turned into a raging addiction, and I found myself playing chess for hours against my companions
                and complete strangers. I took part in my school's Chess Club during all four years of high school.

            <p id = paragraph>
                The biggest lesson I learnt from the game of chess is that a game lost is a game in which a mistake was made.
                This moral inspired me to take accountability for my actions and helped me recognize that I am in control of my own 
                destiny, and if I was in an undesirable situation, it was due to my blunders.
