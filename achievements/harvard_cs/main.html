                To prepare myself for university, I took on the challenge of completing Harvard's first-year computer science course, 
                better known as CS50. The course began on familiar territory, starting with the fundamentals of computer science 
                and syntax in the C programming language. Afterwards, we were introduced to Python and some web development using 
                HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was also using this information that I was able to design and maintain this website. 
                The course content is brilliantly compiled and easy to follow due to the exceptional teaching style of the
                professor, David Malan.

                For me, the most challenging aspect of this course were the assignments that accompany each lecture. But this 
                is what I appreciate about this course, since it challenges me to use my creative thinking abilities in a way I have 
                not been forced to before. As of today, I have completed more than half the course and will keep updating this section 
                everytime progress is made.
