                In my freshman year of high school, I focused on improving my skills in the realm of programming and artificial 
                intelligence. I had previously completed a beginner-friendly Python course and looked forward to further my 
                knowledge. As a result, my parents enrolled me in a 4-month machine learning course in a very popular educational 
                institute located in India by the name of BYJU's.

                Using Python in a platform known as Google Collab, I learnt how to operate with various machine learning models and 
                algorithms, but worked with RandomForestClassifier for majority of the course. Thanks to my wonderful instructors, I 
                received my certification at the end of 2021.
