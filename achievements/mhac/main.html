                My school has one of the best Mental Health Awareness Clubs in all of GTA. This club was responsible for hosting 
                various thanksgiving events and awareness campaigns. One such campaign was the invitation of a guest speaker at our 
                school by the name of Sam Demma, who gave our students one of the best speeches on the expectations of others. Some 
                others included collaborations with mental health organizations for Therapy Dogs. Needless
                to say, our MHAC was a diverse community of caring students who strove for mental well-being.

                Due to the exceptional leadership and marketing from our executives during the 2022/23 academic year, all members 
                of the MHAC were awarded a certificate for 'Promoting well-being' at our school by the region of Peel.
