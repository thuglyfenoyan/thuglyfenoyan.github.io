                Going into Grade 9, the most intimidating subject for me was French. For the 14 years before high school, I had  
                never learnt French (all I could say was Bonjour). Before the start of my French course, I took some help in mastering 
                the basics of French grammar. These classes helped me tremendously, as I ended the course with the highest mark in my 
                grade, winning me the Subject Achivement Award for French. I also got one for Careers a year later.

                I had maintained a relatively high average throughout high school, resulting in me getting the Honour Roll 
                certification in all years of high school for keeping an 80% average or above. In all my years, I was in the Special
                Distinction category for maintaining a 90% average or above. <br><br>
