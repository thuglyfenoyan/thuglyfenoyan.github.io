                During Grade 10, our robotics team consisted of some very smart members. It was in this year where I was mentored 
                by the same person who founded the <a href="../../extracurriculars/others/main.html">Problem Solving Club,</a> and improved my knowledge on programming in robotics. Our
                first tournament of the year took place inside Humber College in Brampton. This was a district event, which meant 
                that teams from all over Ontario participated here.

                The event itself was quite exciting, with us qualifying for the VERY LAST position in the playoffs. From this point 
                onward, our alliance dominated and won the final match in a thrilling contest, sealing our victory. It was the first 
                time in the history of our school where we had won a robotics competition, and every member felt proud 
                of this accomplishment. In addition, our team had also qualified for the provincial championships for the first 
                time, which added to our list of achievements for the 2022 season.
