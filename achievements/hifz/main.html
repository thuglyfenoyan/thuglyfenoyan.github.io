            <p id="paragraph">
                This tedious, tiresome and lengthy journey began in July 2017 on a random Tuesday night when I was feeling spiritually 
                uplifted. I felt the need to start memorizing portions of the Qur'an out of nowhere. At first, I was easily 
                accomplishing the self-assigned task to the extent where I asked my parents to enroll me in a Madrasah (an Islamic
                school) for 2 months. In this time, I performed quite well and it increased my hopes of completing my memorization 
                journey within the next 2-3 years. <br><br>
                The Qur'an is split into 30 parts (roughly 604 pages). I had memorized 9 of these in my first year and when my second year was about to 
                begin, my family decided to move to Canada from Saudi Arabia. Finding a Madrasah in Canada was difficult, but after 3 
                long months, my parents enrolled me in Masjid Al Farooq. It was in this Madrasah, 
                where I revised my final verses before the completion of this jounrey. On April 17, 2020, I was granted the title 
                of 'Hafiz', which is an Arabic term for 'Protector'. <br><br>
                It was not an easy accomplishment by any stretch of the imagination. The road was full of ups and downs, and my 
                parents were present for me when I felt defeated. This act was done for the sake of God Almighty, and my parents 
                motivated me throughout the journey for which I am ever grateful.
