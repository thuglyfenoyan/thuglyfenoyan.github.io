                As founder of the Arduino club, I decided that it would be a great idea if we ended the first academic year with a simple
                project that bring all acquired concepts together. Every week, we learnt something about a new Arduino component and by 
                the end of the year, everybody had a solid understanding of how IR sensors, motor drivers and DC motors worked. 
                <br><br>
                The most difficult part of the project was preparing a reasonable design. Due to conflict of interests and very less 
                time, we decided to use a wooden block as the base of the robot. Furthermore, 2 IR sensors were to be mounted on 
                the right and left front sides respectively. The front of the robot was supported by a toothbrush while the back was 
                driven by 2 DC motors, all being controlled from one L298N motor driver. The Arduino board itself was powered through a 
                power bank.

                I wanted my club members to show me what they have learned throughout the semester, so I helped them as little as I can.
                When they were desperate, I aided them to get out of the problem. The biggest problem we faced was when our IR sensors 
                were not reading values consistently. However, this problem was fixed within a few minutes after we got a teacher to screw
                the IR sensors properly.

                Most of the construction was completed by my good friends, namely Shreekavin Umasankar, Muhammad Saajid, Muhammad Nomaan
                and Supreet Pamma. The programming was controlled by Sabarisan Sabaratnam and Bilal Yasini. There were 
                other members in the club as well, but they were not main contributors to the final project.

                The project was completed on the last meeting of the year. The amount of relief felt after encountering numerous obstacles
                was huge and it was a moment for the dedicated club members to congratualte themselves for completing one of the many big 
                projects that they will pursue in their lives. <br><br>
