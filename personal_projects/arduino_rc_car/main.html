                Using an Infrared Receiver and a TV remote, I was able to manipulate an Arduino-based robot car. An IR receiver can detect 
                bursts of Infrared light sent by a controller. This is the same technology that is used in audio, entertainment and 
                television systems.

                When the green light was turned on, the robot was turned on and any controls sent through the remote-controller would have 
                been accepted. However, if the red light was turned on, the robot would have stayed stationary. To enable any sort of movement, 
                a 'power' button must be pressed.

                This project was completely independent and took 2 days to complete. It was a great addition to my Arduino projects 
                folder, and inspired me to create similar robots down the line. <br><br>
