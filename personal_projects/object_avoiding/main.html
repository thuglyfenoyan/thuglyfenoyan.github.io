                The Obstacle-Avoiding Robot, which was one of the most time-consuming projects of the Arduino Club, involved an ultrasonic sensor 
                mounted on top of a rotating servo to measure the distance between the robot and an object at a certain angle. If an object 
                was detected at a close range, the robot would autonomously rotate towards a completely different direction where 
                no object was detected.

                The programming, design and soldering was completed by me whereas the rest of the 
                assembly was completed by a club member. <br><br>
