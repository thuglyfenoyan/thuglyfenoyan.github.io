        <h2>Portable Distance Sensor with Arduino</h2>
        <p id="paragraph">
            My first Arduino related individual project was a distance sensor device that was made portable using a power bank. 
            I made use of a regular ultrasonic sensor that comes with the Arduino Uno Beginner Kit (HC-SR04). This sensor was mounted 
            at the very edge of the breadboard so that the distance between the device itself and the object can be measured precisely.

            <i>Apologies for the blurry pictures. The first picture shows the device correctly detecting 5cm and the second 
                picture shows the device correctly detecting 15cm. Both values are visible on the LCD screen.

        <!-- Portable Temperature Project  -->

        <h2>Portable Temperature Sensor with Arduino</h2>
        <p id="paragraph">
            Building on top of my previous project, I created a device that utilized a DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor to measure
            and display those values on an LCD screen in Celsius and percentage respectively. This was another individual Arduino project 
            that I completed.
        </p>

        <div id="project-pics">
            <img src="TemperatureSensor.jpg" class="image" alt="device displaying correct temperature">
        </div>

        <p id="paragraph">
            <i>As shown on the thermostat, the correct temperature is indeed 25 degrees Celsius. Unfortunately, the thermostat did
                not display the humidity to verify, so we can assume it was somewhere near the measured value.
