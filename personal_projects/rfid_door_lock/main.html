                Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology can be easily used in security systems, where only certain tags are 
                given access to a service. In this case, me and my friend, Parin Patel, used a unique tag to unlock a bolt lock.
                A redefined version of this device could be used in actual houses.
                <br><br>  
                A stripped 22 AWG wire was used to connect a servo to the handle of the bolt lock. Since these wires are strong, the door
                was unlocked and locked by simply manipulating the angle of the servo motor. In addition to an RFID scanner,
                we used an LCD display to simplify UI. The programming, designing and a portion of the assembly was handled by me. 
                The rest of the assembly was done by Parin.

                This was definitely my coolest project at the time. I thought of ways to improve the security on this particular 
                system, and that evolved into a <a href="../two_factor_auth/main.html">separate project</a>. <br><br>
                The source code for this project can be found at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thuglyfenoyan/RFID-Door-Lock/blob/main/RFIDDoorLock.ino">my GitHub.</a>
