        <h2>Computer Science Assignments Automation with Python</h2>
        <p id="paragraph">
            In my Computer Science classes, there were lots of tasks that became quite repetitive and boring after a short time. For 
            example, every student had to follow a certain template before writing their program in Java. I noticed that everybody else
            in my class was manually typing out the entire template of more than 20 lines by memory (inefficient). What began as a simple
            automation task using Python to create Java classes for me became a successful project that even some of my classmates began
            to use.

                By running a simple command in the terminal, I was able to create a .java file with the entire template written inside. Afterwards,
                I deleted the entire file. If the program was compiled and had a .class file, the delete-class function would have removed
                that as well.

            This 'Python package' of mine had a lot of efficient functionalities, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Creating classes: Creates a new .java file with the default template pre-written (as shown above).</li>
                <li>Delete classes: Deletes the .java AND the .class file to remove all traces (as shown above).</li>
                <li>Copy classes to Clipboard: Useful for pasting an entire .java file to a new IDE such as Repl.it.</li>
                <li>Copy template to Clipboard: Useful for pasting an entire template to a new IDE such as Repl.it.</li>
                <li>Rename Classes: Renames the file and class (and any other instances of filename inside the class). It can also delete old .class files to avoid errors.</li>
                <li>Create 'test' classes: During assignments, it is very common to test a sample of code before implementing it in the main program. This function creates an original test file everytime it was called.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Molar Mass Calculation  -->

        <h2>Molar Mass Calculator</h2>
        <p id="paragraph">
            One of the most arduous tasks in Grade 11 Chemistry was calculating the molar mass of a molecule. This was normally
            the first (and easiest) step to a larger problem, but it was time-consuming. I have a Casio fx-9750GIII graphing calculator
            that is programmable in Python, so I decided to create a program that would calculate the molar mass by simply inputting 
            some numbers about the molecule.

                Suppose we want to get the molar mass of H<sub>2</sub>O. The first question asks us the TOTAL number of atoms inside the molecule (3).
                Next, we are asked for the atomic number of the first atom in the molecule (Hydrogen is 1). Next, we are prompted to input 
                the number of Hydrogen atoms inside the water molecule (2). The same process repeates for the next atom (Oxygen). The correct 
                answer is 18.02 g/mol, as shown above.

            <br><br>
            Even though the example above is shown on the terminal, this program was meant for graphing calculators so that it can be
            easily accessible. This program is one of the many examples of me trying to use my programming knowledge to benefit me in school.
