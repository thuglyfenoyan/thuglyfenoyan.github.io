                A continuation of my <a href="../rfid_door_lock/main.html">previous project</a>, the two factor authentication door 
                lock system implemented both the RFID technology and a membrane keypad to ensure maximum security. In order to unlock
                the door, one must possess the correct card and enter the 5-digit passcode. The RFID in this project was 
                programmed through an Arduino Nano and the rest of components were controlled through an Arduino Mega.

                <i>Project Demonstration</i><br><br>
                This project taught me a lot. I learnt the importance of a good design and organized program, since I spent most of the 
                time online finding solutions for the problems I encountered. The lessons I learnt through the building of this prototype 
                is still applied in all my projects today. <br><br>
