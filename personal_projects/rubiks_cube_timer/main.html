                One of my biggest hobbies in Grade 9 was speedcubing, which is the art of solving various Rubik's cube-like 
                puzzles in the least amount of time possible (My personal best on a regular 3x3 Rubik's Cube is 13.98 seconds).
                I had built quite a collection of puzzles over the years.

                One boring day, I felt the urge to use my Python programming knowledge to build
                a Rubik's Cube timer with various functionalities. Some of these included:
                <ul>
                    <li>modes for 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 and 6x6 puzzles</li>
                    <li>calculating the cubing averages</li>
                    <li>accessing history</li>
                    <li>deleting solves and updating history by doing so</li>
                    <li>displaying statistics for each puzzle mode</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p id="paragraph">
